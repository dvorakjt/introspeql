# IntrospeQL

IntrospeQL is a simple package for introspecting PostgreSQL tables and functions
and generating TypeScript types from them. The aim of the package is to
make the capturing of PostgreSQL types and the generation of TypeScript types
easy and accurate.

This will become the alpha version of this package. I plan to start by
implementing the features I currently need, but if there is a need for more
features, I am will be happy to work towards implementing them in version 1.
